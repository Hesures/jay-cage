            <p>Flamenco music, as many other music styles, has a characteristic beat. The beat is the meter on which the different styles are performed.</p>
            <p>Flamenco more than covers the metric system of traditional Hispanic music, putting it at your service to build a music with a universal character. Flamingos measure their music in <code>ternary</code>, <code>binary</code> and characteristic <code>amalgam</code> time (binary + ternary).</p>
            <p>Some styles, many of us would say, have opted for a rhythm that does not adopt a specific beat, they are the so-called <code>free styles</code>, such as:
              <ul>
                <li>malagueñas</li>
                <li>tarantas</li> 
                <li>granainas</li> 
                <li>tonás</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>We will see these kind of beats and some of flamenco styles inside them, called <code>palos</code> in spanish, that means "branch" as the branches of the Flamenco Tree.

          <p>The binary compass has two beats per compass.<br>
            Each beat of a measure can in turn be divided into two or three smaller parts, which is known as binary or ternary subdivision measures. For example, the 2/4 time signature, which can accommodate 2 beats, is a binary subdivision time signature since each part is divided into two in turn.</p>

          <p>The predominant measure in flamenco styles is the ternary, thus, for example, all fandangos, whether from Huelva, Málaga or Granada, are performed on a 3/4 ternary measure.</p> <p>Like the sevillanas, which are also sung, played and danced over a 3/4 time signature. Each of these styles, although performed over the same measure, has a different rhythmic key, as well as a peculiar guitar accompaniment. </p>
          <p>In Malaga the fandangos are accompanied in 3/4 on a rhythmic key known as abandolao, which corresponds to the Spanish bolero of the 19th century.</p>

          <p>The amalgam measure of a binary and a ternary one, the alternation of a 6/8 measure with another of 3/4 (or vice versa), gives rise to a 12-beat musical metric, with which the rhythmic key of the most important flamenco styles:

              <li>soleá</li> 
              <li>seguiriya</li>

          <p>Also called "free styles" or "in free rhythm" are all styles or styles that do not adhere to any fixed pattern of time, so we cannot say what measure they are in.</p>
          <p>They are styles in which the performer (be it the singer and / or the guitarist) "moves" freely (said musically, <em>ad libitum</em>) to allow greater expressiveness.</p>
